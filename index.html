        <!--More explanation about connection to Sims-->
        <p id="cap">I have been playing the Sims games since I was little. I never played the very first game, but I played the second, third, and fourth. If I had to choose between all of them, I may pick the Sims 3.</p>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>I grew up with these games. In recent years, I have played the Sims 4 msot often. However, I was able to find the Sims 2 and the Sims 3 on sale on the EA website. I have all the games except the first, since I am not very interested in its limitations.</p>
        <!--I love these games!-->
        <p>For all the nostalgia and comfort possible, I will always come back the Sims games!</p>
